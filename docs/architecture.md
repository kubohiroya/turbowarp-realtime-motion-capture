## Build outputs

The project keeps runtime behavior and compatibility metadata separate while generating both from
the same checked-in source definitions.

```text
src/index.ts + src/extension.ts
  -> vite-plugin-turbowarp-extension
  -> dist/<extension>.js

src/config.ts + src/block-definitions.json
  -> extension-api-manifest Vite plugin
  -> dist/extension-manifest.json
```

The manifest plugin runs in Vite's post-build phase. This preserves the JavaScript plugin's
single-output validation and adds the manifest only after the TurboWarp bundle is complete.

## Extension API manifest v1

`schemas/extension-manifest.schema.json` is the normative JSON Schema. `formatVersion` is `1` and
must change when an incompatible manifest shape is introduced.

The v1 contract contains:

- the TurboWarp extension ID;
- each block opcode and block type;
- each argument ID, argument type, and optional menu reference;
- each menu ID and whether it accepts reporter blocks.

Blocks, arguments, and menus are sorted by their identifiers before serialization. Text,
descriptions, default values, and static menu items are intentionally excluded because they do not
identify saved-project API references. A compatibility checker can therefore distinguish API
changes from documentation or localization changes.

The manifest and TurboWarp blocks are the package's public API. Source-level controllers and ports
are internal implementation seams and are not npm exports. See the
[extension API reference](turbowarp-extension-api.md) for loading order, lifecycle values, errors,
and data contracts.

## Drift detection

`dist/` is committed as a release artifact. `npm run check:dist` rebuilds both files and fails when
Git reports any modified, deleted, or untracked file below `dist/`. This catches manifest and bundle
drift in local checks and CI.

## Offer QR vertical slice

`config/feature-flags.ts` keeps `qrCourierPairing` startup-fixed and default OFF. When enabled, the
extension requires `kubohiroyaWebRtcCapability` version 2, calls `createOffer(peer)`, and retrieves
the completed pairing code with `getOffer(peer)`. It never reaches into another extension's private
instance.

The unchanged printable-ASCII pairing code is wrapped in versioned `twmp-qr/1` parts. Every part
contains a random session ID, peer and message identity, zero-based ordering, total source length,
and a SHA-256 digest. A conservative byte-mode capacity check bounds each QR to Version 40. The
wire input is limited to 128 KiB, 64 parts, and 4096 characters per chunk.

Display uses renderer-only SVG skins. The current drawable skin is retained, a generated skin is
attached without creating a VM costume, and cleanup restores the retained skin before destroying
the temporary resource. Project stop, extension disposal, explicit cleanup, and displayed-target
removal all release sensitive QR data.

## WebGPU MoveNet MultiPose vertical slice

`webgpuMoveNetMultiPose` is an independent startup-fixed, default-OFF flag. Startup imports only the
TensorFlow.js WebGPU backend, explicitly calls `setBackend("webgpu")`, verifies the selected backend,
and then creates `MoveNet` with `MULTIPOSE_LIGHTNING`, tracking enabled, and bounding-box tracking.
Any non-WebGPU result fails closed; there is no CPU, WASM, or WebGL inference fallback.

The controller acquires `{cameraId: "pose"}` through Camera Source and never owns media capture.
Concurrent inference block calls share one promise, so detector invocations do not overlap and old
frame requests do not accumulate. Each successful call reads the latest video frame, requests no
more than six poses, requires model tracking IDs and all 17 named COCO keypoints, and serializes the
result to the `twrmc/pose-frame-2d` version 1 contract.

Stopping waits for in-flight initialization/inference, disposes the detector, releases the camera
lease, and clears the last frame. The TensorFlow.js backend is process-global and is not reset,
because doing so would invalidate resources owned by other extensions; disposing the detector
releases this feature's model resources.

## Owned application contracts and their codec

`protocolV1Codec` is an independent startup-fixed, default-OFF flag. The codec parses at most 1 MiB
of JSON, reads the root `schema` and `version`, and dispatches only explicitly supported TypeBox
schemas. It performs no version inference or fallback. A successful decode retains one compact JSON
value; any failed decode clears it and exposes the first diagnostic as a JSON Pointer path and
message.

This package owns the contracts. `src/protocol/schemas.ts` is the source of truth, `pnpm run schemas`
generates the published JSON Schemas under `schemas/`, and the repository check fails when a
generated file drifts from its definition, when a file name disagrees with the `version` literal or
`$id` it declares, or when a dispatched version has no published file. Applications consume these
definitions through this package and through the published `schemas/` directory; nothing here reads
contract definitions from an application repository, which keeps the dependency pointing from the
application to the extension.

Contracts are versioned, never edited in place. `protocolSchemas` dispatches by schema identifier and
then by version, so `twrmc/pose-frame-2d` accepts v1 and v2 while a v1 consumer still rejects a v2
payload. PoseFrame2D v2 adds up to four glow stick markers per person, each naming the COCO-17
keypoint where a uniquely colored light was observed, its `#RRGGBB` color, and the patch coverage
that produced it. The color is observed on the same video frame and at the same capture timestamp as
the keypoints, so it travels inside the pose frame instead of a second message that a receiver would
have to time-align.

TypeBox tuple and array constraints enforce COCO-17 ordering, six-person limits, matrix sizes, and
all bounded values. A separate recursive key guard rejects WebRTC offers, answers, SDP, ICE/DTLS
material, and credential fields before persistence, even if a later schema accidentally permits a
nested extension point. SessionPolicy also enforces `expiresAt > issuedAt` and rejects expired
policies at application-validation time.

PoseFrame2D `captureTimestampUs` and PoseFrame3D `timestampUs` are opaque values from a separate
synchronized local time service. This extension carries the supplied timestamp unchanged and does
not implement clock initialization, offset estimation, probes, ping, or pong logic.

Several cameras on one page (the standalone app) need no synchronization service: their frames share
the page clock. There the timestamp comes from Camera Source 0.13.0, which reports the capture time of
the frame a frame source was taken at (`frameTime`, from `requestVideoFrameCallback`). The per-camera
pose blocks carry that value unchanged, and skip a camera whose current frame was already inferred.
Nothing under `src/pose` reads a clock; the inference duration reported for measurement is taken
through an injected function and never enters a frame. `scripts/check-repo.ts` enforces this.

## Camera calibration workflow

`cameraCalibrationV1` is startup-fixed and default OFF. A session validates the camera and
calibration identifiers plus a 3–20 by 3–20 inner-corner chessboard and a square size in meters,
then obtains a named Camera Source lease. The actual first frame dimensions become immutable for
the session; later resolution changes fail before detection.

Each explicitly requested sample performs one temporary video-to-canvas copy. The exact-pinned
OpenCV.js 4.12 WebAssembly backend is bundled but lazily initialized by the first sample or solve.
It detects the complete chessboard, refines corners to subpixel
precision, and scores board coverage plus Laplacian sharpness. Quality below 0.2 and views within
0.015 normalized RMS corner displacement of any retained view are rejected. The controller retains
8–40 diverse samples and does not run a continuous CPU sampling loop or a second reference solver.

`calibrateCamera` produces the intrinsic matrix, distortion vector, and RMS reprojection error. The
last sample is deliberately reserved as the stage-world board placement. Its returned rotation and
translation are inverted into the row-major 4 by 4 `worldFromCameraMatrix`. Results above the
configured RMS threshold or outside CameraCalibration v1 bounds do not replace the last valid
profile.

Cancel, project reload, and extension disposal release the lease and temporary samples while
keeping the last validated profile in memory. Explicit cleanup clears that profile too. Import uses
the same exact v1 schema and recursively rejects pairing-secret keys. The 11 MB uncompressed bundle
increase is accepted to keep the sole production backend available on an offline venue LAN; real
camera/board geometry and WebAssembly startup remain browser E2E responsibilities.

## PoseFrame3D avatar retargeting

`avatarRetargetV1` is an independent startup-fixed, default-OFF flag. It requires runtime key
`turbowarpAFrameCapability` and calls `requireVersion(2)`; it accepts no other version, so an
A-Frame build without capability v2, such as 0.3.0, is refused. It uses the public scene
operations and the VRM operations of that capability, and never accesses A-Frame DOM, Three.js
objects, or GLTF internals. Capability v2 is published in `@kubohiroya/turbowarp-aframe@0.4.0`.

An asset registration records a VRM URL and a validated root placement. Binding a person creates
an empty node from a holder template, loads the VRM onto it, and waits until it is ready; a failed
load removes the node and the binding. Applying a frame requires corresponding exact-v1
PoseFrame3D and PoseFrame2D values. A person is joined only by PoseFrame3D `personId` equal to
PoseFrame2D `trackingId`; this is not temporal alignment.

The adapter maps both COCO-17 records deterministically to the 33 positions required by
exact-pinned `kalidokit@1.1.5`. Screen coordinates use PoseFrame2D `frameWidth` and `frameHeight`;
world coordinates retain the external service coordinate values. Missing BlazePose face, hand, and
foot points are midpoint-interpolated or duplicated with reduced visibility. Kalidokit `Pose.solve`
with `runtime: "tfjs"` and `enableLegs: true` is the sole rotation solver. Its hips result drives
the configured root scale and offset.

Kalidokit solves a mirrored selfie view for VRM 0.x bone axes. Its `Right*` outputs come from the
performer's left landmarks, so each output turns the opposite VRM humanoid bone, which moves the
performer's own side. The rotation is written in degrees to the normalized bone: normalized bones
use the VRM 1.0 axes, a half turn about Y from VRM 0.x, which negates x and z, and driving the
opposite side mirrors the rotation across the midline, which negates y and z; together the signs
become (-x, -y, z). This was checked on a VRM with Kalidokit 1.1.5 and synthetic poses: an arm
lowered 30°, one arm held level, a raised knee, and a forearm reaching forward each moved the
performer's own limb in the same direction. Kalidokit's arm output barely separates an arm raised
above level from one lowered below it, and it reported no spine lean for a leaning torso, so the
spine and hips signs follow from the same derivation but are not yet observed. There is no
custom rotation fallback. Joint or person confidence below the binding threshold skips only that
transform and preserves its prior value.

At most six person IDs bind to unique template instances. Recognition transitions use configurable
A-Frame events, allowing the application to connect Performance DSL start/end effects without this
adapter owning effect execution. Per-person capability failures are collected as `partial` state so
other avatars continue. Rebind, explicit reset, project lifecycle reset, and disposal emit end when
possible, delete created instances, and clear temporary state.

PoseFrame3D is exact v1 boundary data from a separate 3D service. Its `timestampUs` is opaque and is
only copied into recognition event data. This extension performs no frame alignment, history
retention/query, triangulation, or 3D solve. Kalidokit is deprecated upstream and expects native
BlazePose landmarks; the deterministic COCO-17 expansion is therefore an explicit accuracy
constraint, and retargeting still requires validation with real recordings before release.

## Frame sync pattern vertical slice

`frameSyncPatternV1` is startup-fixed and default OFF. It answers one question for the fusion
application: how long after an event each camera computer finishes recording the frame that shows
it.

The display side paints a full-screen overlay with a 4 by 4 panel on black. Twelve cells hold a
millisecond counter that wraps every 4096 ms; four hold check bits derived from the counter. A
camera exposure that straddles a display refresh mixes two codes, and the check bits reject that
reading instead of letting a wrong time through. What is drawn during one animation frame reaches
the screen at the next refresh, so the encoded time is the current clock reading plus one measured
refresh interval; the remaining projector delay is common to every camera and cancels out of the
per-camera offsets.

The camera side takes a named Camera Source lease and never calls `getUserMedia`. Each delivered
frame is downscaled to a 240 by 180 luminance buffer that is reused between callbacks because the
decoder reads it synchronously. Calibration runs in two phases on the live pattern: the first 60%
of the window records per-pixel minimum and maximum luminance and takes the largest connected
high-range region whose bounding box is panel shaped, and the rest learns each cell's own light and
dark level and measures how often readings decode. Uneven projection is why levels are per cell, and
a reading that lands between a cell's learned levels is discarded. Calibration fails with
`panel-not-found`, `low-contrast`, or `decode-unstable` rather than returning untrusted latencies.
The accepted window starts at 6.2 seconds, derived from the slowest cell's 2048 ms change period and
the share of the window the levels phase gets, so a window that cannot see every cell at both levels
is refused up front instead of failing later as low contrast. Both phases end on the shared clock, so
a stalled camera never leaves the controller waiting, and stopping mid-calibration settles the
pending run without recording a camera fault.

Decoded frames are queued as observations. Timestamps are opaque readings from the external
synchronized time service, taken when the frame reached the application; the browser-reported frame
age is exposed separately for callers that want the sensor exposure moment instead. Clock probing,
latency samples, and the aggregated per-camera report belong to the WebRTC extension, so no clock,
offset, ping, or pong logic lives here.
## Multi-camera 3D pose fusion

`poseFusion3D` is an independent startup-fixed, default-OFF flag. The fusion app feeds the buffer
with PoseFrame2D JSON received over WebRTC data channels; this extension owns neither the transport
nor the clock.

Every camera gets its own timestamp-ordered ring buffer. Slot count is derived from the configured
delay and jitter window, bounded to 16 to 600 frames, and at most 16 cameras are buffered. An
in-window reorder is inserted at its timestamp position by shifting the shorter side of the ring, so
the common in-order append stays O(1). A duplicate timestamp, an arrival older than the newest frame
minus the jitter window, and an arrival older than the oldest retained frame of a full ring are
counted as dropped instead of buffered. None of this estimates a per-camera clock offset: capture
timestamps stay opaque values from the separate synchronized local time service.

A frame is only buffered when a calibration profile for its `cameraId` is loaded and that profile
describes it: a mismatched `calibrationId` or frame size would otherwise be triangulated silently
with the wrong intrinsics. Such frames, like duplicates and late arrivals, are counted as dropped
rather than thrown, because ingest runs on the data-channel hot path and one misconfigured peer must
not break a running project script. Because only calibrated cameras are buffered, stray camera IDs
cannot occupy the ring buffers either.

`fuse PoseFrame3D at buffered delay` resolves the newest buffered timestamp minus the configured
delay, and every camera is resampled at that single past instant. A keypoint bracketed by two frames
is interpolated linearly; a keypoint that is occluded on one side of the bracket keeps the visible
observation instead of blending a low-confidence estimate into it; a camera without a bracket, or
with a bracket wider than twice the jitter window, holds its nearest frame for at most one jitter
window and otherwise contributes nothing.

Cross-camera association scores every pair of tracked persons from different cameras by the mean
two-view reprojection error over their shared confident keypoints, requiring at least four shared
keypoints and stopping at twelve. Pairs are merged greedily from the lowest cost, and a merge that
would place two views of the same camera in one person is rejected. Two-view triangulation uses the
closed-form midpoint of both viewing rays, which keeps this quadratic stage off the iterative
solver; the general case still uses the score-weighted linear solver with a relative Jacobi
convergence threshold. One fusion at the 16 camera by 6 person limit measures about 80 ms, against
about 1 ms for four cameras and two performers.

Each cluster covered by at least two cameras is triangulated per keypoint with a cheirality check
and a reprojection check. When the full view set does not agree, every two-view seed is scored by
how many views fall inside the reprojection threshold, and the largest consensus set is
re-triangulated; a minority of wrong detections is therefore discarded instead of dragging the
keypoint away from the truth, while views split evenly between two consistent answers stay
ambiguous. Pixel observations are undistorted with the OpenCV rational model of the profile, so 0,
4, 5, or 8 coefficients are supported and anything else is rejected when the profile is loaded.

A registry keeps stable `person-N` identifiers by camera and tracking-ID overlap, and keeps the last
triangulated position of every keypoint. A keypoint left with fewer than two confident views holds
that last position and reports score `0`, so consumers can distinguish measured from held values.
The assembled frame is checked against the pinned PoseFrame3D v1 schema before it is retained.

Empty buffers, fewer than two covering cameras, and an instant with no multi-camera person are
expected transient states: they report `false`, keep the last fused frame, and expose an error code.
Invalid JSON, a foreign schema, and an invalid calibration profile throw. The stop button, project
reload, and extension disposal clear buffers and fused results; explicit cleanup also clears the
loaded calibration profiles. `PROJECT_RUN_STOP` deliberately does not: the runtime emits it whenever
the thread queue empties, and an event-driven fusion project that buffers frames from hat scripts
would otherwise lose its jitter buffer between messages. Camera leases and temporary skins are still
released there.

## Glow stick assisted identity and orientation

`glowStickMarkers` is an independent startup-fixed, default-OFF flag. On the camera side, each
inference samples one patch per configured keypoint of every tracked person from the same video
frame, in one temporary canvas that is released immediately. A patch is scored by hue: pixels below
the saturation or value threshold are ignored, the remaining hues are averaged circularly so a
wrapping red stays red, and a patch qualifies only when enough of it carried the color. The strongest
observation per keypoint becomes a PoseFrame2D v2 marker; the frame stays v1 while sampling is off.

On the fusion side the Performance DSL supplies the performer colors, and a fusion-side setting says
which keypoint each performer carries the light at, because that contract does not describe the
carrying hand. Each camera sample is assigned greedily from the strongest observation, and one
performer never claims two people in the same camera.

An assignment does two things. It fixes identity: the fused person takes the performer's identifier,
so `personId` survives occlusion, re-entry, and tracking-ID churn, and the association step refuses
to merge views of different performers while merging views of the same performer before any
reprojection cost is considered. It also fixes orientation: a color found on the mirror of the
performer's keypoint means that camera labelled a back view as a front view, so the view's left and
right keypoints are swapped before triangulation. Without that correction the swapped view pulls
every limb across the body or fails the reprojection gate entirely.
